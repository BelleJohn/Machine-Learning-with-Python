    "<h3>Local Features, Corners and Interest Points</h3>\n",
    "In computer vision, finding interest point in an image is essential for subsequent processing. An interest point is a point in the image which, in general, has a clear (preferably mathematical) definition, a well-defined position in the image space. Further, the local image structure around the interest point is rich in local information content. Ideally, it is robust under local and global perturbations in the image (illumination/brightness changes), such that it can be computed with a high degree of repeatability.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Interest points are used in further processing: image stitching, object recognition, gesture recognition, tracking and many more.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>You can read the introductory part of the paper <em>Local Invariant Feature Detectors: A Survey</em> by Tuytelaars and Mikolajczyk in PDF format (<code>survey_inv_features.pdf</code>) found in your exercise folder.

    "<a name=\"task1\"></a>\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: red\">Task 1: Finding Corners and Interest Points</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Corners and interest points refer to point-like features in the image, which have a local two-dimensional structure. Specifically, a corner can be defined as the intersection of two edges. Most corner detetion algorithms are sensitive to local image regions which have a high gradient change in both x- and y-direction. In practice, most corner detection methods detect interest points in general, and the terms \"corner\" and \"interest point\" are used interchangeably throughout the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interest point detector is an algorithm that chooses points from an image based on a defined criterion. Typically, an interest point is obtained as a local maximum of a function calculated over an image region. A <em>descriptor</em> is a vector of values, which describes the image patch around an interest point. The simplest descriptor would be as simple as the raw pixel values around the interest point, or more complicated, such as a histogram of gradient orientations. The interest point and its descriptor are together called <em>a local feature</em>.\n",

    "<h4>Harris Corner Detector</h4>\n",
    "The Harris corner detector basically finds under a sliding window a change in intensity in all directions. The window function is usually either a rectangular window (1 in window, 0 outside) or a Gaussian. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(u,v) = \\sum_{x,y} \\underbrace{w(x,y)}_\\text{window function} \\, [\\underbrace{I(x+u,y+v)}_\\text{shifted intensity}-\\underbrace{I(x,y)}_\\text{intensity}]^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to speed up the calculation, this measure can be approximated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(u,v) \\approx \\begin{bmatrix} u & v \\end{bmatrix} M \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is a 2$\\times$2 matrix computed from image derivatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M = \\sum_{x,y} w(x,y) \\begin{bmatrix}I_x I_x & I_x I_y \\\\ I_x I_y & I_y I_y \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get an understanding what that formula means, consider first a corner with its axes aligned to the image's axes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M = \\begin{bmatrix}I_x I_x & I_x I_y \\\\ I_x I_y & I_y I_y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\lambda_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If either $\\lambda_1$ or $\\lambda_2$ is close to zero, the patch is not considered to be a corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the (general) case of a corner whose axes are not aligned with the image's axes, we can perform an Eigenvalue decomposition on the matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M = R^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix}\\lambda_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 \\end{bmatrix}R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and still think the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A corner response function:\n",
    "$$ R = \\text{det}(M) - \\alpha \\text{trace}(M)^2$$\n",
    "gives a cornerness score of the patch. $\\alpha$ is empirically chosen to be usually between 0.04 and 0.06.\n",

    "All feature detectors observed above are rotation-invariant, which means, even if the image is rotated, we can find the same corners. However, a corner may not be recognized such if the image is scaled. A corner in a small image within a small window is flat when it is zoomed in the same window. Therefore, the Harris corner detector is not scale-invariant.\n",

    "\n",
    "<h4>SURF</h4>\n",
    "SIFT algorithm was rather slow and its speed-up was proposed in 2006 by Bay, Tuytelaars and Van Gool. In SIFT, Lowe approximated Laplacian of Gaussian with Difference of Gaussian for finding scale-space. SURF goes a little further and approximates LoG with Box Filter. One big advantage of this approximation is that, convolution with box filter can be easily calculated with the help of integral images. And it can be done in parallel for different scales.\n",
