Welcome to my **PyTorch Learning Notes** repository!  
This repo is to record what I learned from the video [Learn PyTorch for deep learning in a day. Literally.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA), which offers a fast yet solid introduction to PyTorch fundamentals. <br/>
[All code on GitHub](https://dbourke.link/pt-github)  <br/>

## 📚 Why This Repo?  
I previously completed several exercises while following the video, but unfortunately, I didn’t save my notes 🥲.  
To rebuild my foundation properly, I created this repository to **relearn**, **document**, and **practice** everything step-by-step, ensuring a stronger and more sustainable understanding.

## ✍️ What’s Inside  
- Personal notes summarizing key concepts and intuition.  
- Hands-on exercises, debug insights, and mini-practice tasks.  
- Code snippets and experiments to reinforce learning.  

## 🛠️ Topics Covered  
- Tensors and Operations  
- Building Neural Networks from Scratch  
- Training Loops and Backpropagation  
- Using PyTorch Modules  
- Optimizers and Loss Functions  
- Image Classification Example (MNIST)
- Transfer Learning
- Experiment Tracking
- Paper Replicating
- Model Deployment
- PyTorch 2.0 and torch.compile

## 🔥 Goals  
- Build a personal knowledge base for PyTorch.  
- Understand deep learning fundamentals through practice.  
- Set the foundation for future deep learning and reinforcement learning projects.
