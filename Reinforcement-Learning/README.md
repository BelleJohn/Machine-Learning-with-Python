# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Practice

Welcome! This repository is created for my personal journey in learning **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.  
I’m exploring the theory, intuition, and practical coding of RL algorithms using Python and [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) environments.

## 📚 Learning Resources

I'm following a combination of theoretical and practical resources:

### 📘 Book  
**Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)** by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto  
- Link: [http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)

This book provides the foundational concepts and mathematical background of RL.

### 📺 YouTube Series  
A hands-on coding playlist that helps implement RL with Gym and Stable-Baselines3:  
- Link: [Reinforcement Learning in 3 Hours | Full Course using Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mut_u40Sqz4&list=WL&index=14&t=141s)

It complements the book by demonstrating how to apply the concepts with real code.
