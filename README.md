# Study Notes and Practice 📚✨

Welcome to my Study Notes and Practice repository! 🚀
This is where I document my learning journey through detailed notes and hands-on exercises as I explore various topics, enhance my skills, and track my progress. Beyond serving as a learning log, this repository also functions as my personal knowledge base.

I thrive on divergent thinking—connecting seemingly unrelated ideas and uncovering new methods through creative insights. This approach not only enriches my learning but also reflects how I tackle challenges and generate innovative solutions in real-world projects.

## 🧠 What’s Inside  
This repository contains:

- **Study Notes** 📝: Key concepts, debug process and solutions, summaries, and insights from the materials I learned.
- **Practice** 🔄: Exercises, mini-projects, and code snippets to hence concepts.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
Here are some of the main topics that I focus on:

- **Data Science** 📊: Data analysis, cleaning, visualization, and machine learning techniques.
- **Machine Learning & Deep learning** 🤖: Algorithms, models, and hands-on practice with PyTorch mainly.
- **Signal Processing** 🎵: Feature extraction, filtering, and analysis of time-series signals.  
- **Image Processing** 🖼️: Computer vision techniques, feature detection, and enhancement methods.  
- **Prosthetics** 🦾: Bio-signal processing, EMG-based control, and related research areas.
